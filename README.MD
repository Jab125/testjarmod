# Test Jarmod
## Setup
Run `gradlew setupDevWorkspace`
## Building
To build a copy for local use, use `gradlew compileMinecraft`, the resulting jar is not distributable!
## Stability
This repo is merely for playing around with jarmodding for people who don't want to use MCPReborn. Stability of the patches is not guaranteed.

The maven may stop serving the required files at any time.
## TODO
The TODO list currently includes the following:
- A way to export binary patches.
- A custom installer that installs to `.minecraft` that uses those patches.
- Use tiny v2 mappings instead of tiny v1
- Use Fernflower instead of CFR
