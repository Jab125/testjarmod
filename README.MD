# Test Jarmod
## Setup
Run `gradlew setupDevWorkspace`
## Building
To build a copy for local use, use `gradlew buildMinecraft`, the resulting jar is not distributable!
## Stability
This repo is merely for playing around with jarmodding for people who don't want to use MCPReborn. Stability of the patches is not guaranteed.

The maven may stop serving the required files at any time.
